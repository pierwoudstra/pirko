reshape of the www.pirko.nl website.

to do:
- convert png's to webp or jpeg
- use grid and not flex for all the project pages
- make about page interactive

including some new design principles:
- 'and' becomes '&'
- all social media/ work links are on the first page
- written from my own perspective
- inspired by Mladen StilinoviÄ‡
- more links
- the use of dotted boxes
- more margins on the sides for more white space

all the types of text on the site:
- welcome text
- project titles (on home page)
- project titles (on project page)
- text on project page
- name next to logo
- page index

the following font's should be divided by the types of text:
- instrument serif
	very readable font, good for subtitles
- chivo mono (medium 500)
	even more readable and good as standard font

pages:
	home
	about
	ram6
	(a) history of mountains
	pirko
	bok dida
	three women named svetlana
	more experiments
		two people shaking hands
		brontophone
		zadar sea organ
		spitsmuis
