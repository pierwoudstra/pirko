reshape of the www.pirko.nl website,

including some new design principles:
- 'and' becomes '&'
- all social media/ work links are on the first page
- written from my own perspective
- inspired by Mladen StilinoviÄ‡
- more links
- the use of dotted boxes
- more margins on the sides for more white space

all the types of text on the site:
- welcome text
- project titles (on home page)
- project titles (on project page)
- text on project page
- name next to logo
- page index

the following font's should be divided by the types of text:
- instrument serif
	very readable font, good for subtitles
- chivo mono (medium 500)
	even more readable and good as standard font
- VT323
	not so readable but pretty for titles or small extras
